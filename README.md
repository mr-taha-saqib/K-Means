# K-Means Clustering Tasks

## Task A: Built-in K-Means Function
1. **Use the Built-in K-Means Function**  
   - Apply the built-in K-Means clustering function (e.g., from `sklearn`) on the given dataset.
   - Features to use:
     - **Annual Income**  
     - **Spending Score**

---

## Task B: Custom K-Means Algorithm
1. **Design Your Own K-Means Clustering Algorithm**  
   - Implement the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch.
   - Steps to include:
     - Initialize centroids randomly.
     - Assign data points to the nearest centroid.
     - Update centroids based on the mean of assigned points.
     - Iterate until centroids stabilize or the maximum number of iterations is reached.
   - Features to use:
     - **Annual Income**  
     - **Spending Score**

### Tools and Libraries
- **Built-in K-Means**: `sklearn.cluster.KMeans`
- **Custom Implementation**: Python (using `numpy` for computations)
